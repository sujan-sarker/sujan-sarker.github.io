## 💻 Projects
---------------------

### [2025 - present ]
------------------------
* **Hierarchical Vision-Language Framework for Multi-Robot Collaboration**, Developed a hierarchical vision-language framework enabling multiple robots to execute interdependent tasks from free-form natural language instructions. Integrated centralized planning with LLM-based subtask decomposition and predicate-driven synchronization.Introduced a multi-robot benchmark covering sequential, parallel, and coupled coordination scenarios.

### [2023 - 2024 ]
------------------------
* **Embodied Referring Expression Comprehension**, Designed a multimodal framework for grounding human referring expressions using verbal and nonverbal cues. Created _Refer360_, a large-scale multi-view, multi-sensor dataset of natural human--robot interactions. Developed _MuRes_, a lightweight guided-residual module for improved multimodal representation learning

### [2023 - 2024 ]
------------------------
* **Hierarchical Robot Learning Framework for Decision Making and Control**, Led multidisciplinary research on autonomous robotic assembly in collaboration with General Motors, GE Research, and Siemens. Developed a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework leveraging simulated and real-world experience for efficient decision making and control.

### [2023 - *2024* ]
------------------------
* **Leveraging LLMs for Preference Modeling**, Developed a preference-aware decision-making framework using LLMs to infer human preferences from sparse interaction histories.Integrated preference estimation with sequential decision-making for adaptive behavior in collaborative tasks.


### [2021 - *2022* ]
------------------------
* **IHABOT: Intelligent Hospital Assistance Robot to Fight Contagion by Reducing Doctor-Patient Interaction**, Funding Agency: Centennial Research Grant, University of Dhaka.
